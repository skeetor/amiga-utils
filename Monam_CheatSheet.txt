Monam Shortcuts and Tips
========================

<LA> - Left Amiga Key
<RA> - Right Amiga Key

<C> - Any Control
<LC> - Left Control
<RC> - Right Control

a/b - Press either a or b, both keys work
a-b - Press a AND b, you have to press both keys to trigger the command


Entering addresses
==================
	Default is hex, so you don't need to enter a leading '$'.
	You can enter also a symbol, or a register like (pc, d0, etc.).
	If you really want to get to address $d0 you have to specify it with
	the hex value ($d0) otherwise the current address is taken from 
	register D0 is used.
	Example:
	<RA>-a
	d0 -> set address to value of register D0

	<RA>-a
	$d0 -> set address to $d0

=============================================================================
<TAB> - Cycle between the windows one after another

<RA>-b - Set breakpoint
	Set a breakpoint to the specified address

<RA>-a/m - Set address
	When the Dissassembly or Memory window is active, you are asked to enter
	an address and the top line is changed to that address. For other windows
	this doesn't have an effect.
	Example:
	<RA>-a
	d0 -> set address to value of register D0
	
	<RA>-a
	$d0 -> set address to $d0

<C>-z/<C>-y Single step current instruction
<C>-t Execute current instruction
	The difference to <C>-z is, that this shortcut steps over instructions
	like jsr/bsr while <C>-z will enter the subroutine.

<C>-r Run
	Starts the execution of the current application until it stops
	or a breakpoint is hit
