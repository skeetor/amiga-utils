    Install a CIA-B interrupt for calling _mt_music or mt_sfxonly.
    The music module is replayed via _mt_music when _mt_Enable is non-zero.
    Otherwise the interrupt handler calls mt_sfxonly to play sound
    effects only. VectorBase is 0 for 68000, otherwise set it to the CPU's
    VBR register. A non-zero PALflag selects PAL-clock for the CIA timers
    (NTSC otherwise).
